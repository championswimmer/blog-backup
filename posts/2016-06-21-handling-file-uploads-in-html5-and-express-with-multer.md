The [Open Event Webapp Generator](http://open-event-generator.herokuapp.com/) has a pure HTML front end form, and Express based backend.

We needed an option where users can upload their own JSON files to create a schedule page for it.

On the HTML form that’s easy. As you can see here we simple add input tags with type=”file”

    <input type="file" name="sponsorfile" id="sponsorfile">
    

In our express app, we need to use [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) to be able to handle file uploads.

We create a middleware called uploadedFiles, and pass the middleware to the get() block

    var express = require('express');
    var multer = require('multer');
    var app = express();
    
    var upload = multer({dest: 'uploads/'});
    
    var uploadedFiles = upload.fields([
      {name: 'speakerfile', maxCount: 1},
      {name: 'sessionfile', maxCount: 1},
      {name: 'trackfile', maxCount: 1},
      {name: 'sponsorfile', maxCount: 1},
      {name: 'eventfile', maxCount: 1},
      {name: 'locationfile', maxCount: 1}
    ]);
    
    app.post('/live', uploadedFiles, function(req, res) {
             // req.files has the files
             // req.body has the POST body params
      });
    });
    

Now we can access the files inside `req.files` (that will have a path to the temporary location of the file, you’ll have to use some filesystem module to read the files), and the POST params in `req.body`
