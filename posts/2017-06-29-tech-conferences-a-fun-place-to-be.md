So I have had the good fortune to [present at quite a few tech

conferences](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgc7EY7uwmbUyKQwLWYDIiVSPvj_nQm6A).

A large number of them have been at [HasGeek](https://medium.com/@hasgeek)

events. Quick shoutout to [Kiran Jonnalagadda,](https://medium.com/@jackerhack)
[Zainab Bawa,](https://medium.com/@zainabbawa)[Karthik

Balakrishnan,](https://medium.com/@karthikb351)[Sandhya

Ramesh,](https://medium.com/@sandygrains)[Hari

(ഹരി)](https://medium.com/@haricm) and everyone else on the HasGeek team for the

awesome tech conferences they host. It was also an honour to be on the Editoral

board a couple of editions of Droidcon too.

*Putting those thanks aside right in the beginning, because here is where I

start making fun of conferences. :P The HasGeek events are some of the most

sorted conferences in India, but I have been to some other ones too, which are

not that . . . well put together.*

So a lot of funny things happen at conferences. When you haven’t gone to one

yet, or have attended maybe just one before, you have this assumption that this

is a place full of serious people, who mean business, accumulated here to gain

valuable insights from eminent and knowledgeable speakers.

But what tech conferences are, could be wildly different. There’s strictly two

specific motivations for attending them. For speakers — you get to travel to a

new city for free (if the organisers have managed to get quite a few sponsors on

board, you get lodged into a decent hotel too). And for the attendees — you get

free lunch, and your company pays for you to attend it. So for one whole day,

you don’t need to dredge through your scrum in your gloomy desk, and instead

meet new people, have good food and munch on free donuts.

And you also get to take selfies in front of cool wall art like this

**Why do companies send their employees to these conferences you wonder?** Well

isn’t it obvious ? To learn new about the latest and greatest in the software

world (read: participate in the hype cycle). 
**But that doesn’t always work

out**. Because you see, other than geeky developers, who else goes to tech

conferences ? Greasy startup founders and technical recruiters. Who are always

lurking to poach employees. So that bright developer you sent to pick up new

skills at #AwesomeConf ? Too bad, **Pochr.io** just nicked him.

#### The Talks

![fig3](/content/images/2018/04/fig3.jpg)
The Gartner Hype Cycle. I am perennially on the trough of disillusionment, while

the rest of the world seems to be constantly on the peak of inflated

expectations

Most conferences will divide their talks into 3 categories, based on their

difficulty and/or depth —

1. **Beginner** — These are on topics which are in the first slope of the hype

cycle. Imagine Kotlin in 2016 or TensorFlow in 2015 or React in 2014. And these

talks are nothing but the exact content you’ll find on the ‘Getting Started’

page of the respective technology. It’s slightly worse than the Getting Started

page, because that page gets updated in the future. This talk will get recorded

and uploaded on Youtube as a permanent record of poor topic selection, if the

said technology’s hype cycle bursts.
2. **Intermediate — **These are the opinionated as f*** talks. This is the category

into which every mediocre conference speaker proposes a “Best Practices for

Creating a ___ project” talk. This is the category into which every judgemental

developer proposes a “What not to do when working with ____” talk. This is

usually going to be about a technology that the whole world is already using,

but the ecosystem is not mature, so everyone is figuring shit out on their own,

and there are no ‘best practices’ yet, so everyone thinks their variable names,

function names, folder structures and file names are the best. Like everyone

Javascript conference will have a talk on Vue, and every speaker will have

his/her opinion on whether Axios is better or Vue-resource is. Every Android

conference is talking about the pros and cons of RxJava.
3. **Advanced** — This is where the fun is. Advanced talks will usually be about a

technology that is in use since the advent of computers. *But* it will be about

a particular niche which only 8 developers from Valley and 2 from Bangalore are

working on. This category is called ‘advanced’ not because the technologies used

are complex, but because it deals with something like — ‘*When we were scaling

up, our NodeJS codebase was so large the number of require() calls hit the Unix

process limit of number of open files*’ — i.e. the kind of problems engineers at

Facebook or Google scale worry about, or people with a funded research on ‘how

to screw your computer’ ponder over.

#### The Speakers

While those were the types of talks. There are also a handful of types of

speakers you get at these conferences. Any speaker can be put into one of these

categories.

- First there will be the **geeks with untested demos**. These guys do not have

slides. They want to give you a tech demo. Of a product that uses the latest,

most unstable version of every tool possible, that runs on a prototype kit that

they got from their last I/O or WWDC trip. These guys are found fidgeting with

their demo 2 minutes before their talk is scheduled in the speakers’ lounge. The

demo, will invariably *not work*. Then they will tell you, in the most

unconvincing tone you’ve ever heard, what it would have been like, **had the

demo worked**.
- Then there will be the **product guys**, the **marketing heroes** hidden under

the developers’ capes, the **sellers**, the smart talkers. They will convince

the editorial panel in all ways possible it is not a pitch of their product or a

blatant marketing of their **‘all new platform that will make developing a

breeze’**. (I’ve been on the editorial board. When an interview starts with “*I

don’t want to promote it in anyway but. . .*”, I know exactly where it’s

headed). These are the guys who tend to use use phrases like ‘and this is where

all the magic happens’. You know when to call bullshit now if you hear this

right ?
- Some of us are the **regular guys**. The **usual suspects**. The **weathered

speakers**. We have spoken at multiple conferences, and we know the feedback and

reviews of the conference will depend more on the quality of lunch, than our

slides. We know you’re here for a company-paid day off with free food and some .

. *ahem . . *networking. We know you’re not really sitting here to understand

how important it is to set objects volatile and functions synchronized for

error-free multi-threading. We know the true reason you are here — **you are

here for the memes, the jokes, and the gotchas.** And we follow the footsteps of

lord [Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/) and the supreme

leader [James Mickens](https://mickens.seas.harvard.edu/wisdom-james-mickens).

(The liberal use of **we, **if had not clearly pointed out, then yes, this is

the category I belong to).

Here you go, meme-ified, on your face facts, about how your Digital money isn’t
all that safe
- Finally there will be the **visionaries**. The **legends**. The **torch bearers

of technology**. The keynote speakers. These will be guys like [Ryan Dahl,

showcasing his summer project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztspvPYybIY) —

that eventually turned into NodeJS. Or [Phillip Roberts casually telling you

about the Event Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ). Or it could

be the creator of Wordpress, Socket.IO and Mongoose — Guillermo Rauch (trivia:

caught up with him smoking a desi joint an hour before this talk) [describing

the future of chat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfpLCdSBEJA) These guys are

the reason the handful of serious attendees who have come, are here for. These

guys don’t talk code, or 10% performance bumps. These guys talk ideas. But never

mind, because you won’t get it now. And when you’ll get it, it’d have been too

late to jump onto the hype train.
- There is also this one last type of speaker, for whom there is a** special place

in hell**. The guys who propose “**Building for the billions**” talks. And there

is going to be at least half a dozen such proposals. “*User Experience for the

next billion”, “Design for the next billion internet users” *and what not.

Here’s the thing — there are only a handful of apps on the play store with more

than a billion downloads: **Gmail**, **Google **Search (because they’re bundled

in every Android phone), **Whatsapp **(because it’s the new SMS), **Messenger

**(because Mark effin Zuckerberg forced everyone to download it), **Twitter

**and **Facebook **(because 1 billion adults are shitposting cat pics on the

internet everyday). If you’re not Facebook, Twitter or Google, you need to get

your ducks in order and figure out how to **GET AT LEAST 1 BILLION USERS**

before you can *design better for the next billion. *You know who needs to build

for the next billion ? [This

guy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ShakeMe.shake&amp;hl=en).

Your app that solves NP-hard problem ? No one cares.

#### The Networking

.. or huddling around that one Google employee there, wagging your tails hoping

to . . . idk what ? Get a job ?

So networking at tech conference is downright favour currying. You are either

recruiting talent for your next ‘1 billion user’ idea (if you’re a CTO). Or

you’re trying to appear deeply interested in the conversation one speaker is

having with another about a language you first heard 1 hour ago. Or you’re

trying to ask intriguing follow up questions to that big-company developer who

just spoke in the pre-lunch session, and are only managing to ask the most

obvious google-searchable questions.

Then there’s going to be that one huddle of undergrad open source developers

(who are on sponsored tickets), gorging on all the available chicken and ice

cream, and discussing about the best gaming laptop and having a dick-measuring

contest about their Github commit-streak. THAT IS NETWORKING. At least they are

having fun doing it.

There’ll be also be some horny fellows in a corner trying to make a pass on one

of thinly spread female attendees.  Geez. Please don’t. Like

everything else in a shitty conference is still fine. But this isn’t. Wondering

why there aren’t enough women in tech, this could be one of the reasons

</serious note>

#### The Sponsor Kiosks

The most important part of the pilgrimage to a tech conference, is to visit the

shrine of every sponsor. Because the offerings from the the divine sponsors are

what keeps us going from one conference to another. Like literally, all 4 years

of college, I did not buy a single **T-shirt**. Whenever I would run out of

shirts, I’d turn up at hackathons and tech conferences and grab a dozen new

ones.

Some of the upright ones, like Digital Ocean and Facebook would be having an

open table of **stickers**, **pens**, **notepads **and other

corporate-marketing-enwrapped **swags**. Then there’ll be snide data collectors

who’d be like, fill up this form and get a T-Shirt. Like seriously ? You think

I’d give up some of my real data for a free T-Shirt ? 
 Then, there are some

who try to gamify the heck out of it. Udacity was making us answer a quiz to

give us a **mug**. I just cheezeballed my way with the lady on the counter to

get mine. I am sure so did others. Quiz my ass.

Here’s a golden rule about sponsor kiosks. Don’t go asking about open roles and

asking about technology. Like just think it over. These companies, who’d love to

make you work on Sundays too, have sent these folks for 3 whole days to stand at

kiosks and take selfies with attendees. Guess who these folks are ? Yep the

temps, interns and the most dispensable ones. They ain’t giving you any jobs.

The know nothing about the next SDK release. Get back to the lunch, or the next

talk about the next billion users please.

The best part about a tech conference is that they give you this black

side-carry bag, which has this one recyclable pen made of paper pulp, which

breaks apart the moment you put some pressure on it to write. There would be a

notepad — they’re actually expecting you to take notes. And there’ll be a bunch

of marketing material. Now the sponsors are charged extra for their marketing

brochures to be put into this bag. The best use, personally, I had of these

brochures, was to fan myself when sitting outside the auditorium in of the

conferences I attended in hot and humid Chennai. And the cherry on the cake

would be that conference T-Shirt, which if you wore, would look like a Formula-1

driver, because of the number of sponsor logs printed on it’s back. It’ll never

be a size that fits you. And you cannot give away a T-Shirt with that many

sponsor logos to anyone but your younger brother.
